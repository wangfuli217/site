  Actually, this is not a design flaw, and it is not because of
  internals, or performance. It comes simply from the fact that
  functions in Python are first-class objects, and not only a piece of
  code.

  As soon as you get to think into this way, then it completely makes
  sense: a function is an object being evaluated on its definition;
  default parameters are kind of "member data" and therefore their state
  may change from one call to the other - exactly as in any other
  object.

  In any case, Effbot has a very nice explanation of the reasons for
  this behavior in Default Parameter Values in Python. I found it very
  clear, and I really suggest reading it for a better knowledge of how
  function objects work.
